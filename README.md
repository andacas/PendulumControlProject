# PendulumControlProject
This project aims to explore different control techniques for pendulum systems, including PID, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Deep Learning methods. The project will involve simulations using Python and Gazebo, as well as real-world implementation using a Raspberry Pi and ODrive 3.6 motor controller.
